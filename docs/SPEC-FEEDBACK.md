# Reference-implementation notes for the spec writer

`docs/SPEC.md` mirrors the canonical specification, now at **v0.40**. This file
collects what the reference does that the text doesn't yet describe.

## Open

Nothing. Every note from the v0.39 round is settled in v0.40 (below).

## Settled in v0.40

Adopted as the reference already does it:

- **Forced purges under a deployment operator grant** skip namespace rules. A purge
  forced with a branch's own `*` key is still judged (§6.4.3).
- **Request-shape errors** (`400`, `413`, `415`) may come before authentication;
  nothing else may (§6.2).
- **Gestures on config writes** (§7.2, §7.4):
  - config writes carry gestures;
  - a batch's config change gets none;
  - undoing config is out of scope.
- **The gestures listing** (§7.4):
  - pages by `{resource}/{id}`;
  - leaves out purged resources;
  - answers `404 not_offered` in sealed namespaces.
- **The batch body bound** leaves room for the batch's own envelope (§7.5).
- **Sealed namespace log ranges** may be evicted and sealed again (§E.2.2, §9).
- **`keep`** is `422` at E3, and E3 retention is a key-holding client's job (§8.6).
- **Role entries:** the core reads `can` and `rules`; `includes` is the catalog's
  (§7.4).
- **Signatures** are stored and served, and the server doesn't verify them (it MAY
  where it knows the key, with `422 signature`). Bundle tools SHOULD verify when
  they can (§C.3, §G.4.1). The reference stores and carries them without verifying.

Decided against the reference, which now follows the text:

- **A batch's config change costs a token** from the principal and namespace
  buckets unless it is exempt (a `*` key, or only a freeze), as a config write does
  (§6.6). A config-only batch used to cost nothing.
- **A branch of a non-public base can't be public, sealed or not** (§7.4, §7.6,
  §C.5.1, §E.4). Ciphertext would be safe, but names, sizes and timing aren't. The
  reference again refuses such branches with `422`, and counts public sealed
  branches as dependents that keep a base from going private.

Still open in the spec itself (§13), not in the reference:

- how signers' keys are published;
- what `/rev/{id}` serves at E3 for revisions other than a prune's snapshot;
- test vectors for the byte-exact definitions.
