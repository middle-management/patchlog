# Reference-implementation notes for the spec writer

`docs/SPEC.md` mirrors the canonical specification, now at **v0.43**. This file
collects what the reference does that the text doesn't yet describe.

## Open

Still open from v0.42; the reference's choices stand until the text says otherwise.

1. **"`private`" for end-to-end grants.** Served `private, max-age=300`, with
   `CDN-Cache-Control` and `Surrogate-Control: no-store`; not routed through the
   verifying-edge check.
2. **A batch whose config change is stale** no longer checks signatures: it can only succeed
   as a replay (answered as first recorded), and otherwise fails with the change's `412`.
3. **A dry run** reports `422 signature` per item, like other step-2 errors.
4. **Per-item `422 signature` in batch errors** isn't mentioned in the text.

## Settled in v0.43

- **Which epoch seals a grant:** the epoch of the first entry recording it, or the branch's
  current epoch for a grant only its base recorded (as the reference did).
- **Repeated query parameters** are `400` (as the reference did).
- **`from` binds** like `until`. The reference now refuses grants signed by an operator key
  before its `from`.
- **A line whose `written` is unknown** carries neither `written` nor `grant` (as the
  reference did).
- The gestures listing's `?after=` (a conformance fix in the reference) needed no change in
  the text.

## Settled in v0.42

Twelve of the thirteen v0.41 notes were taken up, plus unknown query parameters:
- the gate position and the signed parent;
- malformed signatures;
- retries;
- the stale-config batch;
- grants in sealed and end-to-end namespaces, and `410` for purged namespaces;
- operator key periods and media type;
- how lines name grants, `written` and key lookup;
- archives with grants.

The text doesn't mention reporting a `422 signature` per item in a batch error; the reference
keeps doing so, like other per-item failures.

## Settled in v0.41

Proposal P1 (signer keys and verification) was adopted as §C.3.1, with these
refinements over the proposal:

- signer entries are a `signers` array in the root block, not Datalog facts;
- tombstones have a signing input (`tombstone` in place of the patch set);
- the `Signature` header is `400` on a batch request, and each step carries its own;
- a step's `signature` is always the writer's own: merges and imports never re-send
  originals;
- issuers must check proof of possession and never list one `pub` for two subjects;
- `stored` at `GET /ns/{ns}/grants/{gid}` is defined byte for byte;
- bundle grant lines carry the `key` the grant verified against, attested by the
  exporter;
- the JWK Set lists operator keys only, with `"patchlog": { "from", "until"? }`;
  namespace keys come from the namespace log.

## Settled in v0.40

Adopted as the reference already does it:

- **Forced purges under a deployment operator grant** skip namespace rules. A purge
  forced with a branch's own `*` key is still judged (§6.4.3).
- **Request-shape errors** (`400`, `413`, `415`) may come before authentication;
  nothing else may (§6.2).
- **Gestures on config writes** (§7.2, §7.4):
  - config writes carry gestures;
  - a batch's config change gets none;
  - undoing config is out of scope.
- **The gestures listing** (§7.4):
  - pages by `{resource}/{id}`;
  - leaves out purged resources;
  - answers `404 not_offered` in sealed namespaces.
- **The batch body bound** leaves room for the batch's own envelope (§7.5).
- **Sealed namespace log ranges** may be evicted and sealed again (§E.2.2, §9).
- **`keep`** is `422` at E3, and E3 retention is a key-holding client's job (§8.6).
- **Role entries:** the core reads `can` and `rules`; `includes` is the catalog's
  (§7.4).
- **Signatures** are stored and served, and the server doesn't verify them (it MAY
  where it knows the key, with `422 signature`). Bundle tools SHOULD verify when
  they can (§C.3, §G.4.1). The reference stores and carries them without verifying.

Decided against the reference, which now follows the text:

- **A batch's config change costs a token** from the principal and namespace
  buckets unless it is exempt (a `*` key, or only a freeze), as a config write does
  (§6.6). A config-only batch used to cost nothing.
- **A branch of a non-public base can't be public, sealed or not** (§7.4, §7.6,
  §C.5.1, §E.4). Ciphertext would be safe, but names, sizes and timing aren't. The
  reference again refuses such branches with `422`, and counts public sealed
  branches as dependents that keep a base from going private.

Still open in the spec itself (§13), not in the reference:

- what `/rev/{id}` serves at E3 for revisions other than a prune's snapshot;
- test vectors for the byte-exact definitions.
